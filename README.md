<h1>Data Visualization Using BigMart Data</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In the provided code, we are analyzing the Big Mart sales data using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Let's go through the generated plots and their descriptions:

Mean Sales for Each Outlet Type:
The first plot is a bar plot that shows the mean sales for each outlet size. The x-axis represents the different outlet sizes (Small, Medium, and High), and the y-axis represents the mean sales. The plot provides an overview of the average sales for each outlet size.

Relative Distribution of Item Weight and Item Visibility:
The second plot is a scatter plot that displays the relative distribution of item weight and item visibility. Each point on the plot represents an item in the dataset, with the x-axis representing the item weight and the y-axis representing the item visibility. This plot helps visualize the relationship between item weight and visibility, showing how the two variables are distributed.

Item Outlet Sales Box Plot:
The third plot is a box plot created using the seaborn library. It represents the distribution of the variable "Item_Outlet_Sales." The box plot displays the median, quartiles, and any outliers in the dataset. It provides information about the spread and skewness of the sales data, as well as any potential outliers.

Overall, these plots provide insights into the Big Mart sales data. The first plot shows the average sales for different outlet sizes, the second plot visualizes the relationship between item weight and visibility, and the third plot presents a summary of the distribution of item outlet sales. These visualizations help understand patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
